        <h4> Egg Festival</h4>
        <p>The Egg festival takes place every Spring 13 in the town square as an Easter of sorts. You are given a time constraint to find eggs, and after time is up it is revealed who found the most. Pierre has a mini shop set up nearby during this time!</p>

     <p>The Flower dance is every Spring 24, and it takes place in the Cindersap Forest. You can invite any of the marriageable candidates to dance, but they will not agree unless you have 4 or more hearts. There is also a shop set up at the entrance, with some cutesy flower barrels and other decor.</p>
